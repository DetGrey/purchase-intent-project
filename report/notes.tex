Key points (general)
• don’t forget to be explicit with your research design, that is, what is your overall approach?
could be experimental study, observational study, comparative analysis, etc.
• when phrasing a problem formulation or research question, pay attention to how you are going
to measure the phenomena
• choose stable metrics, e.g., number of generations rather than time training; stable metrics are
not dependent on external factors
• it is always a good idea to see what other research has been done within the area (state of the
arts analysis)

Key points (about our synopsis)
• Don’t use footnotes for references
• "Consequently, many visitors simply browse without immediate intent to buy."; this is a nonsequitur
• Research question: nice
• Data preparation: nice
• concave and irregular is not the same thing
• how will segmentation happen in the DBSCAN case?
• 3: given your dataset and complexity of the domain, are these models a good choice?
• 3: performance: good
• 4: good; you are talking about a comparative analysis; don’t forget to put this in your method
